Code written for the dissertation project during my MSc in Business Analytics at the University of Edinburgh: Text classification of hotels marketing emails

The code leverages NLP analysis. It focuses on tonality classification, and sentiment-analysis algorithms to detect which writing style created the most engagement from the customers.

### Please note that any reference to the hotels data was deleted for confidentiality issues. It has therefore become impossible to run the final notebook making predictions on the hotels e-mails. 
The straightforward way to run the double-classifier model used to be by running the PREDICTION_HOTELS_EMAILS notebook.
